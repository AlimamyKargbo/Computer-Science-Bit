          <h2>Some <strong class="yellow">Important Facts</strong></h2>
          <span>Yahya Deen International Preparratory School is one of the best School in Sierra Leone.
            We offer formal Schooling for English, Arabic,and French Language
            All Students of this noble School are well trained and well enquipe with the best knowledge and skills.
            They speak English,Arabic,and French in and out of the school compound.
            We havve never produce a failure on our past public examination.
            THESE ARE SOME OF OUR QUALITIES: <br>
            1. A clear and shared focus
As we blogged about here, knowing the expectation or goal for a project can often mean the difference between performing poorly and performing well. It’s no different on a school-wide level. When an entire school knows and shares the focus, everyone within that school works better toward the end goal.<br>

2. High standards and expectations for all students
If expectations are high, performance tends to be high as well. We blogged about the power of expectations here. If your school wishes to set high standards, Read Naturally programs can help. At Read Naturally, we begin with a belief in the competence of each and every student. Our programs allow students to work at or slightly above instructional level—in challenging, but not frustrating material—in order to accelerate progress.<br>

3. Effective school leadership
Anyone who has worked in a school understands the importance of having strong leadership. And strong leadership does not begin and end with the administration. A high-performing school has good leaders at all levels—principal, faculty, staff, parents, students, and so on. Read Naturally provides high-quality trainings and individualized coaching services so that teachers may lead others in implementing programs to support literacy development.<br>

4. High levels of collaboration and communication
We can accomplish more as a team than we can accomplish by ourselves. And productive communication is the difference between a team that works well together and a team that falls apart. Schools that have a teamwork mentality and good communication measures—both within the school and as part of a greater community—tend to perform best. Read Naturally programs support students, teachers, administration, and families working together to achieve optimal results for each student, and our strategy builds in clear communication every step of the way in the form of graphs, letters home, reading updates, personal interactions, and more.<br>

5. Curriculum, instruction and assessments aligned with state standards
High-performing schools use research-based strategies and materials. They also train staff to understand state assessments and respond appropriately to the results. Read Naturally programs are research based, research proven, and aligned with best practices. We offer assessment tools that work well in conjunction with standardized assessments to determine which students will benefit from a Read Naturally intervention.<br>

6. Frequent monitoring of learning and teaching
When teachers are able to closely monitor student progress, they can make the appropriate adjustments to ensure each student’s needs are being met. Successful schools incorporate frequent monitoring and offer support to students who need extra help. Progress monitoring is an essential component of the Read Naturally Strategy. Students working in Read Naturally programs monitor their own progress, which is highly motivating and provides data that enables the teacher to make appropriate adjustments. We have blogged about the importance of progress monitoring here, here, here, here, and here.<br>

7. Focused professional development
Successful schools support staff in obtaining high-quality professional development. For schools looking to enhance their offerings, Read Naturally has wonderful professional development options related to literacy.<br>

8. A supportive learning environment
In addition to offering a healthy and respectful school climate, research shows that successful schools offer personalized instruction and small-group interactions to increase student-to-teacher contact. Read Naturally programs, which provide individualized support and valuable teacher/student interaction, are highly conducive to this kind of environment.<br>

9. High levels of family and community involvement
Finally, successful schools embrace the “village mentality” of leaning on family and community members to help with education. Support from parents and guardians is a vital part of Read Naturally programs. In addition, Read Naturally has many friends and partners in the industry to help us in our mission of improving literacy for as many students as possible.<br>

          <p>The paper tests the hypotheses on better academic performance of graduates from stronger high schools and the nature of relationship between college students’ achievements and their academic standing in high school (whether they performed above or below average) with due regard for school characteristics. Regression analysis is used to measure the effects of USE (Unified State Exam) scores, school type, and academic standing on college performance, while controlling for individual student characteristics and cases receiving the Governor’s regional scholarship in addition to the standard student allowance. The sample includes 313 firstyear Economics and Management students admitted to the National Research University Higher School of Economics in 2012 and 2013. Cumulative firstyear ranking points are used as an indicator of academic performance. As it turns out, graduating from an advanced high school or from a school with a high mean USE score in mathematics provides no guarantee of better educational outcomes for first-year students. Highschool academic standing has positive effects on academic achievements in college, the strength of such effects varying depending on school characteristics. Educational outcomes of students who performed above average in low-performing schools can be explained by the high level of intrinsic motivation typical of academically successful students. Therefore, ignoring the information on the academic standing of graduates from low-performing schools may lead to underestimating their academic achievement in college. As for receiving the Governor’s scholarship, this proves to be a significant factor in the academic performance of Management students only..

          <p>Investing In The Right Education Guarantees A Bright Future!
            By admin  Posted June 22, 2015  In Press 0 0
            The best gift parents can give their children is a quality education; one that prepares them for success in life and opens doors to a fulfilling life. It is therefore not surprising to see parents gladly bear the burden of searching for the best school for their children. This quest for the best school leaves me wondering whether the search should be for the best school or the right school.
            It is common to associate the best school with excellent results. We are fascinated by the abilities of these schools to prepare students to pass exams by strictly teaching the learning materials, encouraging rote learning, and administering countless testing. Testing is good but makes teachers to “teach to the tests” only and prevents the overall learning abilities of the students. For such schools, other than the marks in the report cards, what else are we able to know about the leaning abilities of the students?
            In a couple of months, hundreds of Cameroonian high school students will begin to sit the GCE A’ level exams that will determine whether or not they will be accepted by the university of their choice. For most of them, passing the exams is the bastion for a bright future and the exciting transition from adolescence to adulthood. It is also a time that heightens the anxiety of parents about their children’s academic future; a period full of “what if” questions.
            While Cameroon has significantly more public schools than private schools; the popularity of private schools has risen significantly. Parents want to ensure that their children gain the best possible educational opportunities and avenues that lay the path toward lifelong learning, a prestigious higher education and a successful career. For parents wishing to send their children to universities abroad, the anxiety transcends beyond the “what if” questions. Acquiring the service of an agent to help with university application, enrolling the child in IELTS or TOEFL preparatory classes, identifying scholarships available at the universities, carrying out the translation and equivalence of the certificate are their major preoccupations.
            The curriculums on offer in many of the schools in Cameroon limit the students due to the highly exam-driven nature of the curriculums. The students from these schools could make it to the top universities in Cameroon but they lack the combination of globally relevant and necessary skills to be at par with their contemporaries around the world. They also have slim chances when they apply to universities abroad due to the nationally or regionally limiting factor of the certificates or diplomas they get upon graduation.
            Since not all parents are education experts, knowing the right school can be a daunting task. The right school is the one that offers a rich, balanced and challenging curriculum where students are taught and assessed in various ways that equip them with the skills to meet the challenges of the century. Enko Education is fully aware of this challenge of school selection and has berthed in Cameroon to provide the launchpad to the top universities around the world.
            Why the choice of Enko Education? The management of Enko is comprised of highly qualified and experienced administrators of international education and modern corporate governance. Enko education guarantees value for money and a pathway to the top universities in the world at very affordable cost. The curriculum on offer, International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) Curriculum, is globally recognized and delivered by a faculty that is trained and certificated by the International Baccalaureate (IB). For more about the IBDP, please visit www.ibo.org
            The uniqueness of the curriculum Enko Education offers includes the research writing skills acquisition course called the Extended Essay; leadership, interpersonal, and teamwork skills acquisition in CAS (Creativity, Action, Service), and the development of the awareness of knowledge claims and issues in the Theory of Knowledge class. Upon graduation, our students would have had a balance between academic and non-academic engagements to become a whole-person; well-rounded.
